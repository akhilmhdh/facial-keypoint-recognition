# Facial Keypoint Recognition

A project on keypoint detection of face using CNN network architecture. Currently using youtube dataset but needs more to increase the accuracy

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/akhilmhdh/facial-keypoint-recognition.git
cd facial-keypoint-recognition
Run the commands of ipynb (its colab file)
```
## Result
